## Player List

## Chat Area

Shows chat messages sent by other players. Does not show messages sent only to your own team.

You can write a message in the field at the bottom and either press the "Say" button or press the "Enter" key.

If you hold the "Ctrl" key while sending a message, it will be sent to your own team exclusively (and not show up in the chat area).

You can recall past messages sent by you by pressing the Up arrow key repeatedly.
